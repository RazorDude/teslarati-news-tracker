# Teslarati News Tracker

A chrome extension for tracking news from Teslarati. I wrote it to save my time when under stress - I noticed I was clicking my Teslarati link in the browser's bookmarks bar like 10 times a minute to check for news. This extension notifies you every 60 minutes if there's something new to know about :)
